## Innovative Idea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HabituALL is a personalized habit tracker that allows users to track more mundane activities. It differs from a regular to-do list or reminder apps because it focuses on healthy habits that a user would like to improve on or continue. Our website also allows for personal customization through uploading and linking photos and comments to individual habits. The purpose of the images is to allow users to visualize their habits and view progress and improvement over time.

## Important Components
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our website would allow for users to keep track of repeated habits. We would be linking images to dates and/or habits. Comments would be linked to dates and/or images. We should also be able to show a "habits today" page that the user could check off habits that are daily (changes / refreshes every day), weekly (changes / refreshes every week) and monthly (autocomplete). Timeframe changes that allows users to change daily/weekly/monthly overviews that can show the user's habit completion history would be another feature that we are looking to implement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach goals would be data progress analysis and more complex theme customization.
